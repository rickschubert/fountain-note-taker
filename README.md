Fountain Note Taker
===================

I created this Visual Studio Code extension for myself as I am currently writing a theatre play using [Fountain syntax](https://fountain.io/). Being in the second draft phase, I needed a tool that allows me to take notes while viewing and editing the main script. This is where my extension comes in: Now I can move a comment I made in the actual script into a corresponding To Do file. The extension will take care of putting the note into the right place: it will create a new heading with the scene number if there aren't any notes for this scene yet, or it will move the note into the block of existing notes of that scene.
